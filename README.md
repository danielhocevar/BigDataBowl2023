### Submission for the 2023 NFL Big Data Bowl - Undergraduate Track

## Repository Directory

### Code

Our Code directory contains all code applied to complete our NFL Big Data Bowl Project. Under the R directory, we include the R file applied to complete our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Under the Python directory, we include subdirectories with code for our visualizations, CPP data, and survival analysis.

### Dataset

Our Dataset directory contains the csv we used to conduct our analysis of OPLE/DPLE by team. This dataset includes the playId, gameId, CPP data at every frame of the dataset, play data from the Plays dataset as well as information from the PFF Scouting Dataset. This dataset includes only plays discussed in our Data Preparation section of the Kaggle submission.

### Formulas

Our Formulas directory contains a pdf with the formulas we applied to develop our CPP model in addition to our OPLE/DPLE Survival Analysis Metric.

### Figures

Our Figures directory contains all images used in our Kaggle submission for the 2023 NFL Big Data Bowl.
